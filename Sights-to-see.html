        <img src="green.jpg" alt="Situated on Ghana's Central Region's coast, Cape Coast Castle is a painful emblem of both the region's colonial past and the transatlantic slave trade. Originally constructed by the Swedes in the seventeenth century, the fortress was subsequently controlled by the Dutch, the British, and others before emerging as a major hub for the transshipment of Africans into slavery in the Americas.

        The gloomy dungeons and strong stone walls that make up the castle's construction serve as a somber reminder of the horrors that have taken place inside. The terrifying Door of No Return, the notorious entryway used to transport enslaved Africans across the Atlantic against their will, is open for exploration by guests of Cape Coast Castle
