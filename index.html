                Ghana is a western African nation that is located on the Gulf of Guinea coast.
                Ghana, despite its tiny size and sparse population, is one of the most powerful nations in Africa,
                thanks in part to its abundant natural resources and in part to the fact that
                it was the first nation of Black Africans south of the Sahara to win independence from colonial
                domination

                <p1>Ghana is made up of low-lying plains, 
                 rivers, the world's biggest manmade lake, Lake Volta, 
                and the islands of Bobowasi and Dodi, which are located on the nation's south Atlantic coast.
                Ghana is separated geographically into four distinct ecoregions.
                Most of the coast is made up of low, sandy beaches that are dotted with various rivers and streams and bordered by grasses and plants.
                The northern region of Ghana is home to high plains. Part of the Kwahu Plateau and the Ashanti uplands,   
                the wooded plateau stretches over south-central and southwest Ghana. The rough hills of Akwapim-Togo run parallel to Ghana's eastern international frontier. </p1>
